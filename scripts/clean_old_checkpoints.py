## Script to aid in cleaning up old checkpoints from a directory of runs. just prints directories that can be deleted.
## Doesn't delete the latest complete checkpoint or the latest one with step ending in '000'.
# You can pass this to gsutil to delete the directories, e.g.:
# python clean_old_checkpoints.py gs://my-bucket/my-dir | xargs -I {} gsutil -m rm -r {}
